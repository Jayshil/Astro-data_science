    "Radial velocity observations of binary stars (or of stars with planetary mass companions) provide a measurement of the companion  minimum mass, $\\boxed{M_{\\rm min} = M_{\\rm true} \\cdot \\sin{(i)}}$ where $i$ corresponds to the orbit inclination with respect to the line of sight. Radial Velocity observations are blind to the orbit inclination and without additional observation methods such as astrometry, direct imaging or transit, one has to rely on probabilities to estimate the true mass of the observed companion. <br>\n",
    "**Remark:** The convention to describe the orbit inclination $i$ is the following : $i=0$ corresponds to an orbit parallel to the plane of sky while $i=\\pi/2$ corresponds to an orbit perpendicular to the plane of sky.\n"

    "Let's assume that the orbital plane inclinations of binary stars or planetary systems, relative to the line of sight is uniform in all orientations (ie. isotropic). Put in other words, this means that the vector, normal to the orbital plane, is equally likely to be oriented toward any part of the __unit sphere__, or toward any portion of the solid angle $d\\omega$ or $P(\\omega)\\, d\\omega = {\\rm cst}$ (constant).\n",

    "The probability  of the normal vector  of having coordinates $(i, \\phi)$ within $i$ and $i+di$ and  $\\phi$ and $\\phi+d\\phi$ is equal to $P(\\omega)$, ie.\n",
    "$P(i, \\phi)\\,di\\, d\\phi  = P(\\omega)\\,d\\omega$ which leads to $P(i, \\phi) \\propto \\sin{(i)}$ with in the interval $(0,\\pi)$.\n",
